# Computer Vision Assignment 2: Arabic Handwritten Text Identification Using Local Feature Extraction Techniques

This repository contains the implementation and report for **Assignment 2** in the Computer Vision course. The assignment focuses on identifying Arabic handwritten text using local feature extraction techniques such as SIFT and ORB. The goal is to classify images from the **AHAWP (Arabic Handwritten Automatic Word Processing) dataset**, extract features, build classifiers, and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üåü Overview

The objective of this assignment is to:

1. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset**:
   - Load images from the AHAWP dataset.
   - Preprocess images to enhance feature extraction.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extract local features using:
     - **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**.
     - **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)**.

3. **Build Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) Model**:
   - Cluster extracted features using K-means clustering.
   - Create histograms representing the distribution of visual words.

4. **Train Classifiers**:
   - Train multiple classifiers using extracted features:
     - k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN).
     - Random Forest.
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM).

5. **Evaluate Performance**:
   - Use cross-validation to evaluate classifier performance.
   - Report metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Compare Algorithms**:
   - Compare the performance of SIFT and ORB features across different classifiers.
   - Analyze the impact of feature extraction techniques on classification accuracy.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **AHAWP (Arabic Handwritten Automatic Word Processing) dataset**, which contains images of Arabic handwritten text. The dataset includes:
- **Images**: Various samples of Arabic handwritten words.
- **Labels**: Corresponding labels indicating the class of each image.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

The project is implemented using Python with the following libraries:
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and feature extraction (SIFT, ORB).
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating classifiers.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

### Key Steps in the Implementation

1. **Image Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load images from the dataset.
   - Convert images to grayscale and apply preprocessing steps (e.g., resizing, normalization).

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Use OpenCV's `cv2.SIFT_create()` and `cv2.ORB_create()` to extract local features.
   - Apply K-means clustering to create a Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) representation.

3. **Classifier Training**:
   - Train classifiers using extracted features:
     - **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**.
     - **Random Forest**.
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each classifier.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Generate plots comparing classifier performance.
   - Display feature matching examples using SIFT and ORB.
